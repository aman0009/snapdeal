===================


I have some  suggestions on how to increase Interaction with users and make shopping portal more easy.

----------


What Problem I am solving ?
-------------

**It’s all about experimentation to better understand customer needs.  The rise of mobile means people are starting to move away from the mouse and traditional keyboard, we want to be sure our products are available wherever customers are searching**


> - People can access **Snapdeal Chatbot through Facebook Messenger**, an is easy because you don’t need to download an app.
> - Personlized Location biased Bot that would help and show selected queries
> - **Clutter free , Just what you need is what you see. Faster orders**
> - **With this new feature, the process of ordering has become as convenient as chatting with a friend on Facebook messenger**

 Users can start by asking a question of their host from within their account on any device. That includes messaging directly from the desktop, mobile web, or within snapdeal apps on iOS or Android. Users can initiate any kind of conversation they’d like with the accommodation.


 I’m curious to understand people and I’m driven to build great products for them.
  **This bot will help to make the shopping easier for the customers and will increase the customers as it will be an easy way to book the order**
